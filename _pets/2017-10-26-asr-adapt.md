* Published on *IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing*, 2018. [Paper](https://speechlab.sjtu.edu.cn/papers/sz128-zhu-icassp18.pdf)

* Designed an adversarial adaptation method to learn ASR-error pattern for SLU without annotation on ASR hypotheses, and proposed a unsupervised task-adaptation (Bi-LM) architecture for robust SLU.

* Exploited the share part of the parameters in feature encoders to enforce the tasks in a similar feature space, and transferred the transcript side slot tagging model to ASR hypotheses.

* Implemented in *PyTorch*.

* Achieved significant improvements over strong baselines, reached performance very close to the oracle system (Baseline: 81.90%/78.71%; Oracle: 84.65%/85.64%; Ours: 85.11%) on Chinese character level.
